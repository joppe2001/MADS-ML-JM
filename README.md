```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flower-classification.git
cd flower-classification

# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download and prepare the dataset

# Configure the number of classes in src/models/flower_classification.py

# Run the main script
python src/main.py

# Run experiments (optional)
python src/experiment.py

# Deactivate the virtual environment when you're done
deactivate
